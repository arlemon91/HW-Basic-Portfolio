                    Hello "Comies" (coding homies), I am a Chicago-raised Chicagoan that will <strong>always</strong> remind you that they are from Chicago!
                        I am a recent lover of web development and believes I have just found my passion in life. It couldn't come at a better time! 
                        I am currently working on mastering the art of zen and coding with CSS at the same time. I'm not sure how that's going
                        to work out but I will keep you updated. Trust me, I don't know what I'm doing yet but be
                        on the look out for my progress! Happy Coding.
