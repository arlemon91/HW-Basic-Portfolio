# HW-Wireframe

This a basic portofolio made with HTML with CSS.
I used <div> tags to divide sections for the most part to section of so I can add classes/ids later to my CSS. 
 Most of the <div>s are used to format and style all three pages. 
 I also did the best I could with indentation. 
 There are three HTML pages that are linked to each other using an anchor tag <a>.
 All three pages are corespondent once you clink the link and you can click to each page using the nav bar.
 Most of the elements/ tags and codes are free hand and some I did copy/paste method from W3schools. 
 I had a great fustrating time creating these html/css page(s)
 I hopy you enjoy them and please read my nice little insert.
