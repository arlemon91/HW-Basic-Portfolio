        <p>Hello "Comies" (coding homies), I am a recent lover of code who believes has just
        found her passion in life. It couldn't come at a better time. I am currently working
        on mastering the art of zen and code at the same time. I'm not sure how that's going
        to work but I will keep you updated. Trust me I don't know what doing yet but be
        on the look out for my progress!</p>
