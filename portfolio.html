                    <p>Hello "Comies" (coding homies), I am a recent lover of code who believes has just
                        found her passion in life. It couldn't come at a better time. I am currently working
                        on mastering the art of zen and code at the same time. I'm not sure how that's going
                        to work but I will keep you updated. Trust me I don't know what doing yet but be
                        on the look out for my progress!
                    </p>
